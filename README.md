# Punk Api Challenge

An app where the user is able to login and browse through Brewdog beers. The user also has the ability to enter a search for a particular beer, or filter via the ph or abv range. Finally the user can like a particular beer which will show in the favourties section.

This was used to practise:

- React
- Restful API
- Firebase
- Material UI
